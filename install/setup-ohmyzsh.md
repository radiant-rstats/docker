## Install Meslo Nerd Font

Follow the linked instructions to install the <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k" target="_blank">Meslo Nerd Font</a>. 

To use fonts and icons in the Standard macOS terminal with ZSH, change the terminal settings as follows:

> iTerm2: Preferences → Profiles → Text and set Font to "MesloLGS NF"

To use fonts and icons in the Windows Terminal change the terminal settings as follows: 

> Windows Terminal: Open Settings (Ctrl+,), search for fontFace and set value to "MesloLGS NF" for every profile

If you want to have access to the same icons in the terminal in VSCode change the settings as follows:

> Visual Studio Code: Open File → Preferences → Settings, enter terminal.integrated.fontFamily in the search box and set the value to "MesloLGS NF"

To use fonts and icons in the JupyterLab terminal, change the terminal settings as follows:

> Settings: Advanced Settings Editor → Terminal, then enter the below in the `User Preferences` window

```
{
    "fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF",
}
```

To use fonts and icons in the Windows Console Host (i.e., CMD) change the terminal settings as follows:

> Apple Terminal: Open Terminal → Preferences → Profiles → Text, click Change under Font and select MesloLGS NF family

To use fonts and icons in a iTerm2 terminal on macOS with ZSH, type `p10k configure` and answer `Yes` when asked whether to install `Meslo Nerd Font`. Alternatively:

> Windows Console Host: Click the icon in the top left corner, then Properties → Font and set Font to "MesloLGS NF"

## Setup OhMyZsh

> Note: If you are using the RSM-JUPYTER or RSM-JUPYTER-RS computing platform and have run the `setup` command you can skip this step

Start by setting `ZSH` as the default shell instead of `BASH`. On macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2) use the command below from a terminal and answer "y" if prompted.

`chsh -s $(which zsh)`

Run the commands below to install some useful plugins and the `powerlevel10k` theme:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)";
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:=~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-completions;
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions;
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting;
git clone https://github.com/supercrabtree/k ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/k;
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k;
```

Now use VSCode, or another text editor, to make a few changes to the `.zshrc` file. For example, if you have VSCode installed you can use it from a macOS or Windows Terminal by typing: 

```
code ~/.zshrc
```

Replace the `plugins` section in the `.zshrc` file with the code below

```
plugins=(
  git
  zsh-completions
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  autojump
  k
)
```

Then replace `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"` with `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` in `~/.zshrc`. Save the changes and type `source ~/.zshrc` in the terminal to start the configuration wizard. Follow the prompts and select the setup you prefer. You can always update and change the configuration by running `p10k configure` in a terminal.

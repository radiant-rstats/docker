Dockerized Business Analytics
==================================

This repo contains information to setup a dockerized instance with R, Rstudio, Shiny, [Radiant](https://radiant-rstats/radiant), Python, and JupyterLab 

## Install Docker

To use the docker images you first need to install Docker

* For Mac: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/
* For Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/
* For Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

After installing Docker, check that it is running by typing `docker --version` in a terminal. This should return something like the below:

```bash
docker --version
Docker version 18.09.0, build 4d60db4
```

The full `rsm-msba` setup uses Docker Compose so also check this is available by typing `docker-compose --version` in a terminal. This should return something like the below:

```bash
docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.21.1, build 5a3f1a3
```

On windows please install Git Bash:

http://www.techoism.com/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/

For detailed install instructions on Windows see [install/rsm-msba-windows.md](install/rsm-msba-windows.md)

For detailed install instructions on macOS see [install/rsm-msba-macos.md](install/rsm-msba-macos.md)

## TL;DR

To jump straight in and run the main application run the command below on macOS:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -p 8787:8787 -p 8989:8888 -v ~:/home/rstudio vnijs/rsm-msba
```

For Windows run the command below:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -p 8787:8787 -p 8989:8888 -v c:/Users/$USERNAME:/home/rstudio vnijs/rsm-msba
```

Perhaps even easier, you can start the `rsm-msba` container on macOS using `launch-mac.command` and on Windows using `launch-windows.sh`. To get these files download the repo https://github.com/radiant-rstats/docker or clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/radiant-rstats/docker.git` is you have git installed. To run the script on Windows you will need [Git Bash installed](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.18.0.windows.1/Git-2.18.0-64-bit.exe)
 as referenced above.

Another alternative approach is to use `docker-compose` and the command below after cloning the repo:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./rsm-msba/docker-rsm-msba.yml up
```

Note: For Windows you may need to change the path in the `volumes:` section to `c:/Users/$USERNAME`

For more information about running the `radiant` application see [radiant/README.md](./radiant/README.md)

For more information about running the `rsm-msba` application see [rsm-msba/README.md](./rsm-msba/README.md)

## r-bionic

You probably don't want to _run_ this image by itself. It is used in the `radiant` and `rsm-msba` application (see below). To build a new container based on `r-bionic` add the following at the top of your Dockerfile

```
FROM vnijs:docker-bionic
```

To build r-bionic yourself use:

```sh
docker build -t $USER/r-bionic ./r-bionic
```

Push to docker hub:

```bash
sudo docker login 
docker push $USER/r-bionic
```

## radiant

The second image builds on `r-bionic` and adds [radiant](https://github.com/radiant-rstats/radiant) and required R-packages. To build a new container based on `radiant` add the following at the top of your Dockerfile

```
FROM vnijs:radiant
```

To build radiant yourself use:

```sh
docker build -t $USER/radiant ./radiant
```

Push to docker hub:

```bash
sudo docker login 
docker push $USER/radiant
```

Add the following to .Rprofile in your home directory

```r
options(radiant.ace_vim.keys = FALSE)
options(radiant.maxRequestSize = -1)
# options(radiant.maxRequestSize = 10 * 1024^2)
options(radiant.report = TRUE)
# options(radiant.ace_theme = "cobalt")
options(radiant.ace_theme = "tomorrow")
# options(radiant.ace_showInvisibles = TRUE)
```

## rsm-msba

The third image builds on the radiant image and adds python and Jupyter. To build a new container based on `rsm-msba` add the following at the top of your Dockerfile

```
FROM vnijs:rsm-msba
```

To build rsm-msba yourself use:

```sh
docker build -t $USER/rsm-msba ./rsm-msba
```

Push to docker hub:

```bash
sudo docker login 
docker push $USER/rsm-msba
```

The rsm-msba directory also contains a docker-compose file that pulls in a postgres image and database admin tool adminer. To run the full application use the command below. 

```sh
docker-compose -f ./rsm-msba/docker-rsm-msba.yml up
```

## Installing R-packages

If you want to install an R-package, e.g., `fortune`, in a way that persists when using the container again, use the command below. This will install the package and create a personal directory for future package installs. You will only need to add the `lib = Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")` argument once to generate the personal directory.

```
install.packages("fortunes", lib = Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER"))
```

## Installing Python packages

If you want to install a python package, e.g., `redis`, in a way that persists when using the container again, use the command below from the Jupyter (or Rstudio) terminal. This will install the package and create a personal directory for future package installs.

```
pip3 install -U "redis"
```

## Trouble shooting 

To stop (all) running containers use:

```bash
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
```

If the build fails for some reason you can access the container through the bash shell using to investigate what went wrong:

```sh
docker run -t -i $USER/rsm-msba /bin/bash
```

To remove an existing image use:

```sh
docker rmi --force $USER/rsm-msba
```

To remove stop all running containers, remove unused images, and errand docker processes use the `dclean.sh` script

```sh
./dclean.sh
```

## General docker related commands

Check the disk space used by docker images

```bash
docker ps -s
```

```bash
docker system df
```

On mac you can use the commands below to push your custom image to docker hub:

```bash
sudo docker login 
docker push $USER/rsm-msba
```

Add the following to .Rprofile in your home directory

```r
options(radiant.ace_vim.keys = FALSE)
options(radiant.maxRequestSize = -1)
# options(radiant.maxRequestSize = 10 * 1024^2)
options(radiant.report = TRUE)
# options(radiant.ace_theme = "cobalt")
options(radiant.ace_theme = "tomorrow")
# options(radiant.ace_showInvisibles = TRUE)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Start the rsm-msba computing container by double clicking the `launch-rsm-msba-pg.sh` file. In the menu that appears, press 4 + Enter to start the postgres server. Alternatively, copy-and-paste the command below into a (bash) shell from the `git/docker` directory.

```bash
docker-compose -f ./rsm-msba/docker-rsm-msba-pg.yml up
```

... connect to the database using the code chunk below. The default password is "postgres" but you can change that if you want.

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RPostgreSQL)
con <- dbConnect(
  dbDriver("PostgreSQL"),
  user = "postgres", 
  host = "postgres",    ## use when establishing a connection between containers
  # host = "127.0.0.1", ## use when connection to postgres from local Rstudio
  port = 5432,
  dbname = "postgres",
  password = "postgres"
  ## use the line below in interactive sessions
  # password = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")
)
```

Is there anything in the data base? If this is not the first time you are  running this Rmd file the data base should be available already (i.e., the code chunk below should show "flights" as an existing table)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
db_tabs <- dbListTables(con)
db_tabs
```

If the database is empty, lets start with the example at https://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/ and work through the following 5 steps:

1. install the nycflights13 package if not already available

```{r}
if (!require("nycflights13")) {
  install.packages("nycflights13")
}
```

2. Push data into the database 

```{r}
## only push to db if table does not yet exist
if (!"flights" %in% db_tabs) {
  copy_to(con, nycflights13::flights, "flights",
    temporary = FALSE,
    indexes = list(
      c("year", "month", "day"),
      "carrier",
      "tailnum",
      "dest"
    )
  )
}
```

3. Create a reference to the data base that (db)plyr can work with

```{r}
flights_db <- tbl(con, "flights")
```

4. Query the data base using (db)plyr

```{r}
flights_db %>% select(year:day, dep_delay, arr_delay)
flights_db %>% filter(dep_delay > 240)
flights_db %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_time))

tailnum_delay_db <- flights_db %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay),
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(delay)) %>%
  filter(n > 100)

tailnum_delay_db
tailnum_delay_db %>% show_query()

nrow(tailnum_delay_db)

## will produce an error because tail is not support on 
## sql sources
## tail(tailnum_delay_db)

tailnum_delay <- tailnum_delay_db %>% collect()
nrow(tailnum_delay)
tail(tailnum_delay)
```

5. View the data in pgAdmin4

If you used `docker-compose` to start the rsm-msba container, `pgAdmin4` should be running on http://localhost:5050/browser/. You can login using `admin@pgadmin.com` as the user id and `pgadmin` as the password. These settings can be changed in the `docker-rsm-msba-pg.yml` file.  If you used `launch-rsm-msba-pg.sh` to start the rsm-msba container, press 5 + Enter to start up `pgAdmin4`

To connect to the data base, create a new "server" by right clicking on the `Server` icon and choosing _Create > Server_. In the  `General` and `Connection` tabs provide the information shown in the screen shots below and click on the `Save` icon.

See the screen shot below to access the `flights` table. Right click on `flights` and select _View/Edit Data > First 100 Rows_ to get a table view of the data.
